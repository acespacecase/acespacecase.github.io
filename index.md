## Many Hat Wearer

I'm acquiring a lot of hats. By choice. And I love it.

Currently, I'm a **software developer**. I've got an itch to create, to build,
to teach, and to write. I also wear the hats of: designer, web developer,
marketer, writer, and entrepreneur.

On this website I aim:
* to document the programming projects I'm working on;
* to blog about my journey as designer-turned-programmer;
* to provide resources that have helped me along the way to those also learning.
