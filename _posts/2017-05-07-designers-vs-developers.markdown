## Designers vs. Developers

Introducing yourself to new people is an interesting exercise of taking stock of your life and experiences. Distilling yourself into an elevator pitch helps you reframe how you want to present yourself to the world. What’s important to highlight?

As I introduced myself to [Tech Elevator](http://techelevator.com)’s career coach, she asked me why I was switching careers from design to programming.

I recalled how when I first moved to Cleveland (about four years ago), I searched for a design community that I identified with. Events were far and few between.

When I attended an event, I found the information (letterpress, lessons on freelancing, technical skills) interesting but didn’t identify with the other designers.

The more I felt frustrated with the design community, the more I looked to other meet-ups and tech events.

I attended [Cleveland’s GiveCamp](http://clevelandgivecamp.org) in 2015 as a designer, though quickly realized I could apply my HTML and CSS experience as a front-end developer.

In a group of developers, project managers, and business analysts for an entire weekend, I finally felt comfortable. I looked around the room and saw people I wanted as peers.

I found this with most programming meet-ups. People were easy to talk to and genuinely wanted to help each other. Learning something new was the golden standard. Other people cherished it the same way I did (and still do).

So I naturally, this pulled me more into programming meet-ups and away from design. My career mirrored that: my freelance work started involving much more coding and less design.

When I introduced myself, “designer” wasn’t the first word out of my mouth anymore. I found new ways to say I do a little bit of everything, from design to coding to writing.

### The Duh Moment

This was all pretty loosely realized at the time. I didn’t realize I was truly on my path to becoming a developer until quite a bit later. But I did have a pretty stark “duh” moment.

I was meeting with another freelance designer to talk about referrals and collaborations. I asked him if he was planning on going to an upcoming design conference. He responded, “Why would I go to that? It’s literally a room full of my competition. I don’t want to befriend people I’m fighting over clients with.”

Cue the jawdrop.

It was the exact opposite of my opinion. It made me realize how many designers project that same attitude: they protect their ideas in case someone else steals them; they see peers as competition instead of collaborators; they hide away instead of attending events.

I’m not sure if it’s representative of the design community as a whole, though it does sum up a lot of interactions I’ve had. (That being said, I’ve met a lot of designers who recognize this problem and are frustrated by it, too.)

### The Difference

I’ve thought about the difference between the design community and the programming community.

Designers fear their work being stolen or copied at all times because it happens so often. With the current technology, anyone can be a designer. Anyone can make a logo. Anyone can steal a logo, too.

The effects of good design can be hard to measure. Especially to small businesses, investing in a good designer can seem like throwing money away. So often designers have to prove their worth and compete with pricing. It can make you cutthroat and desperate.

Programming, on the other hand, is collaborative. Open source code is common because coders want to contribute to a project. Programming languages, like Ruby, are founded on the principle of being nice to each other.

Apprenticeship is built into company and department structure. Junior developers are mentored by senior developers. Programmers are constantly learning and always asking others for help. Efficiency is important, which means removing roadblocks early by collaborating.

Pair programming is when two people code on one computer: one person types, one person handles the logic. Two pairs of eyes means less bugs and less mistakes. The impulse isn't to fight over who owns the code. 

While design focuses on creative ownership (who owns the idea, who owns the files), programming focuses on the end product (a functional software program) that a group created.

### Lessons Learned

A career isn’t only about the work you do. It’s about who you choose to surround yourself with. I fell into programming because the people pulled me in. And I’m going willingly.
