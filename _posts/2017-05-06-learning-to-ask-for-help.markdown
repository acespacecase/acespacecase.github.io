## Learning to Ask for Help

As much as I’ve known that asking for help *should* be a sign of strength, I typically avoided it at all costs.

Which means when I ran into a problem, my kneejerk reaction would be to either stare at it hoping the answer magically appears, or give up.

As the expression goes, the only thing you get from hitting your head on the wall is a headache.

### Isolating Yourself

For most of my career I’ve worked alone. Working in a company with terrible communication, I decided to work as a silo for the sake of being able to complete my work on time. I taught myself marketing and copywriting to complement by design skills.

After leaving that job, I freelanced full-time for women entrepreneurs. I thrived because I was a team of one, handling anything from writing automated sales emails to designing websites.

When I ran into a problem, I didn’t have a network (either of peers or coworkers) to ask for help. I unintentionally created that problem for myself.

When I decided to teach myself Javascript, every time I couldn’t solve a problem on CodeAcademy or FreeCodeCamp, I would ultimately quit for months at a time. I couldn’t figure out how to ask for help: I had no one in person to ask and I was too nervous to ask on online forums.

Because of this, it took me over a year to learn the basics of Javascript (both syntax and logic)–much longer than it should have if I had simply asked someone for help.

### What Changed

I realized if I wanted to continue learning (learning **anything**, that is), I needed to find people that helped support me, and that I could support in return.

I found a handful of meet-up groups that truly made me feel like a member of the group. Seeing the same people month after month built solid relationships that I felt I could ask for help and not feel dumb.

At [Akron Women in Tech](http://akronwit.org/)’s first Coding Retreat (a full eight-hour retreat to focus on coding without distractions), I was able to ask fellow lady programmers for help or clarification. Being able to ask more nuanced questions helped me understand concepts I was learning faster and more concretely.

For another example, I recently was pouring over someone else’s code looking for a place to change the speed of a Javascript animation event. I knew conceptually what needed to happen, but when I looked at the code I saw dozens of places that could affect the speed. I didn’t want to inadvertently change another functionality of the website I was working on.

So I turned to the Cleveland Tech Slack channel – a group of programmers, designers, business analysts, and entrepreneurs in Northeast Ohio – to ask for help.

I was so insecure in asking for help I even qualified my question by saying that I knew it was a stupid question. But I knew I couldn’t waste more time dancing around the solution, so I needed to ask a group of more experienced Javascript developers for guidance.

And within minutes I had a solution. I fixed the website and that was that. If I hadn’t asked for help I would have sat there for much longer trying to find a solution.

Finding either an in-person or online community that you feel comfortable asking for help is key. You can’t learn very effectively if you isolate yourself.

It can be hard to find people you want to surround yourself with. It takes work and it takes getting outside your comfort zone. Learning is growing. Learning is social.

### Lessons Learned

After receiving help via the Cleveland Tech Slack, I followed it up with how I felt dumb because I knew I was close to the solution. The folks that helped me followed up quickly saying I shouldn’t feel dumb, that asking for help is a big part of the job.

I even wrote one of their quotes inside my code notebook so I would read it often. **“Feeling dumb is a big part of the job.”**

I’m now enrolled in [Tech Elevator](http://techelevator.com). While I knew I could continue to teach myself coding, I knew I needed to de-isolate myself. I needed to learn to learn as a group. I needed to be able to support my classmates and find support within them as well.

With week one done, I’ve realized the immensity of being able to ask a live person for help. Being able to whiteboard different solutions and hear how other people think makes a concept soak in at a different level than if I were watching a YouTube video.

So I continue to tell myself that I need to ask for help. It reduces the amount of time you spend hitting your head on the wall (plus, you won’t end up with a headache). It helps others around you learn because they hear your thought process, which may be completely different than how they were thinking about it.
