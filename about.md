## Many Hat Wearer

I'm acquiring a lot of hats. By choice. And I love it.

I started my career as a print designer, which quickly morphed into digital design (because, well, it's the 21st century). When I began working in a marketing department I taught myself digital marketing and added it to my arsenal.

In the spring of 2016, I quit my day job to freelance full-time. I blended design, marketing, entrepreneurship, and web development daily for some really awesome women entrepreneurs.

**Now, I'm a software developer. I've got an itch to create, to build, to teach, and to write.**

On this website I aim:
* to document the programming projects I'm working on;
* to blog about my journey as designer-turned-programmer;
* to provide resources that have helped me along the way to those also learning.

## When the Tech is Off

After powering down the computer, I enjoy [embroidering](https://www.instagram.com/stacyeharrison/), playing pinball, and drinking copious amounts of tea.

I'm also a pretty loyal listener to a bunch of podcasts, including [My Favorite Murder](https://www.myfavoritemurder.com/), [Last Podcast on the Left](http://cavecomedyradio.com/pod-series/last-podcast-on-the-left/), [Get Up On This](http://www.earwolf.com/show/get-up-on-this/), [How Did This Get Made?](http://www.earwolf.com/show/how-did-this-get-made/), and [the Dollop](http://www.dolloppodcast.com/).
